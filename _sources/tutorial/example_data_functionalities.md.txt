# Data Processing

## Example: Data Processor for Task Pipeline

In this example, you will learn how to apply the data processor of Trinity-RFT to prepare and prioritize the dataset before task exploring and training. This example takes GSM-8K dataset as the example dataset to figure out:

1. how to prepare the data processor
2. how to configure the data processor
3. what the data processor can do

Before getting started, you need to prepare the main environment of Trinity-RFT according to the [installation section of Quickstart](example_reasoning_basic.md),
and store the base url and api key in the environment variables `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` for some agentic or API-model usages if necessary.

### Data Preparation

#### Prepare the Data Processor

As the overall framework of Trinity-RFT shows, the data processor is one of the high-level functions. Trinity-RFT encapsulates the data processor as an independent service to avoid dependency conflict issues. Thus you need to prepare a split environment for this module and start the server.

```shell
# prepare split environments, including the one of data processor
python scripts/install.py

# start all split servers
python scripts/start_servers.py
```

### Configure the Data Processor

Trinity-RFT uses a unified config file to manage all config items. For the data processor, you need to focus on the `data_processor` section in the config file.

In this example, assume that you need to rank all math questions and corresponding answers by their difficulties. So you can set these config items like the following example:

```yaml
data_processor:
  data_processor_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5005/data_processor'
  # task pipeline related
  task_pipeline:
    # I/O buffers
    input_buffers:
      - name: 'raw_input'
        path: /PATH/TO/GSM8K/
        storage_type: 'file'
        raw: true
    output_buffer:
      name: 'raw_output'
      path: /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/JSONL/FILE
      storage_type: 'file'
    # format mapping
    format:
      prompt_key: 'question'
      response_key: 'answer'
```

Here you can set the basic buffers for the GSM-8K dataset input and output and some other items about downstream dataset loading for exploring and training:

+ `data_processor_url`: the URL of the data processor service, which is started in the previous step.
+ `task_pipeline`: the configs for the task pipeline. Task pipeline is used to process the raw dataset. It consists of several inner configs:
  + `input_buffers`: the input buffers for the task pipeline. We usually load from raw dataset files in this pipeline, thus we need to the dataset `path` and set the `storage_type` to "file" and set `raw` to True. It allows multiple input buffers. We can name each buffer with the `name` field.
  + `output_buffer`: the output buffer for the task pipeline. We usually store the processed dataset in files as well, thus we need to set the `storage_type` to "file".
  + `format`: some dataset format config items, which are used to map original data field names to unified ones.

In addition, there are several config items related to the data active iterator in `task_pipeline` part, which is used to prepare a better dataset. The core part of the data active iterator, Data-Juicer, provides tens of operators to help clean or calculate key information for each sample in the dataset. You can configure this part depending on how familiar you are with Data-Juicer.

#### Not familiar with Data-Juicer
If you are not familiar with Data-Juicer, the data processor provides a natural-language-based method to config the data processing recipe. What you need to do is only describe the demands of how you want to prepare for the raw dataset, and an agent will be invoked to arrange the data processing recipe for you. Here is an example:

```yaml
data_processor:
  data_processor_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5005/data_processor'
  # task pipeline related
  task_pipeline:
    # I/O buffers
    input_buffers:
      - name: 'raw_input'
        path: /PATH/TO/GSM8K/
        storage_type: 'file'
        raw: true
    output_buffer:
      name: 'raw_output'
      path: /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/JSONL/FILE
      storage_type: 'file'
    # format mapping
    format:
      prompt_key: 'question'
      response_key: 'answer'

    #### new part about data active iterator
    dj_process_desc: 'Please compute difficulty scores for these math questions.'
    agent_model_name: 'qwen-max'
    clean_strategy: 'iterative'
```

You can write your demand description in config item `dj_process_desc`, and set the model name used for the agent in config items `agent_model_name`. Here we use Qwen-Max as our recipe managing agent. And you can set the `clean_strategy` to 'iterative' to get a better dataset.

#### Familiar with Data-Juicer
If you are familiar with Data-Juicer, you will realize that Data-Juicer provides an operator that can calculate difficulty scores using existing LLMs. In this case, you can prepare your own Data-Juicer data processing recipe and equip this operator. For example:

```yaml
# This is a Data-Juicer data processing recipe
project_name: 'gsm-8k-difficulty'

process:
  - llm_difficulty_score_filter:
      api_or_hf_model: "qwen2.5-72b-instruct"  # use "qwen2.5-72b-instruct" to calculate the difficulty scores.
      input_keys: ["question", "answer"]  # set input_keys and field_names to the existing key names in gsm-8k. Here calculating the difficulty scores according to both questions and answers.
      field_names: ["question", "answer"]
```

After preparing the Data-Juicer data processing recipe, you can set the `dj_config_path` item in the Trinity-RFT config file to the path to this recipe. For example:

```yaml
data_processor:
  data_processor_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5005/data_processor'
  # task pipeline related
  task_pipeline:
    # I/O buffers
    input_buffers:
      - name: 'raw_input'
        path: /PATH/TO/GSM8K/
        storage_type: 'file'
        raw: true
    output_buffer:
      name: 'raw_output'
      path: /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/JSONL/FILE
      storage_type: 'file'
    # format mapping
    format:
      prompt_key: 'question'
      response_key: 'answer'

    #### new part about data active iterator
    dj_config_path: '/path/to/the/Data-Juicer/data/processing/recipe/above.yaml'
    clean_strategy: 'iterative'
```

And you can set the `clean_strategy` to 'iterative' to get a better dataset.



All config items in the `data` section can be found [here](trinity_configs.md). A prepared config file for this example of GSM-8K can be found in [the config file of gsm8k](https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/grpo_gsm8k_task_pipeline/gsm8k.yaml).



```{note}
Only when one of `xxx_pipeline` is provided, and one of `dj_process_desc` and `dj_config_path` in the pipeline config is provided, the data processor and the data active iterator will be activated. Otherwise, this part will be skipped and it will enter into the exploring stage directly.
```

### Exploring & Training
After preparing the config files of Trinity-RFT, you can start your ray cluster and run the RFT process including the data active iterator part with the following commands:

```shell
# start the ray cluster
# on master node
ray start --head
# on worker nodes
ray start --address=<master_address>

# run RFT
trinity run --config <Trinity-RFT_config_path>
```

If you follow the steps above, Trinity-RFT will send a request to the data processor server, the data active iterator will be activated, compute difficulty scores for each sample in the raw dataset, and rank the dataset according to difficulty scores. After that, the data processor server stores the result dataset into the output buffer, when exploring begins, it will load the prepared dataset and continue the downstream steps.

## Example: Data Processor for Experience Pipeline

In this example, you will learn how to apply the data processor of Trinity-RFT to reshape rewards of experiences after exploring. This example takes GSM-8K dataset as the example dataset to figure out how to reshape rewards of experiences from the explorer before sent to the trainer from a view of the quality of generated responses.

Before getting started, you need to prepare the main environment of Trinity-RFT and start server for the data processor according to the first subsection in the previous example.

### Configure the Data Processor

In this example, assume that you need to add an extra reward item to the experiences outputted by the explorer, which access the quality scores of the experiences. So you can set the `experience_pipeline` config like the following example:

```yaml
data_processor:
  data_processor_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5005/data_processor'
  # experience pipeline related
  experience_pipeline:
    # I/O buffers
    input_buffers:
      - name: gsm8k_exp_output
    output_buffer:
      name: reshaped_gsm8k_exp_input
    # format mapping
    format:
      reward_key: 'reward'  # the key name of the reward in the experience
    # data active iterator related
    dj_config_path: 'examples/grpo_gsm8k_experience_pipeline/dj_scoring_exp.yaml'
    clean_strategy: 'iterative'
    # reward shaping
    reward_shaping:
      - stats_key: 'llm_quality_score'
        op_type: ADD
        weight: 1.0

# the buffer config
buffer:
  ...
  explorer_output:
    name: gsm8k_exp_output
    storage_type: queue
    path: 'sqlite:///gsm8k_exp_output.db'
  trainer_input:
    experience_buffer:
      name: reshaped_gsm8k_exp_input
      storage_type: queue
      path: 'sqlite:///reshaped_gsm8k_exp_input.db'
```

Here you can set the input/output buffers for the experience pipeline, and some other items about reward shaping:

+ `data_processor_url`: the URL of the data processor service, which is started in the previous step.
+ `experience_pipeline`: the configs for the experience pipeline. Experience pipeline is used to process the experiences outputted by the explorer, such as reward shaping, data filtering and augmentation. It consists of several inner configs:
  + `input_buffers`: the input buffers for the experience pipeline. It usually loads from the explorer output buffer, so we need to specify the `explorer_output` in the `buffer` config, and here we only need to specify the name that is aligned with the `explorer_output`. It allows multiple input buffers, but for now, we only need to specify one.
  + `output_buffer`: the output buffer for the experience pipeline. It usually writes results to the input buffer of trainer, so we only need to the specify the buffer name that is aligned with the `trainer_input` in the `buffer` config.
  + `format`: some dataset format config items, which are used to map original data field names to unified ones. Here we only need to specify the field name to store the original reward information.
  + `reward_shaping`: the method to reshape the reward. Usually we use some stats computed by operators in Data-Juicer as new reward items. It's a list that allows multiple methods to reshape rewards. Each item in the list has the following config items:
    + `stats_key`: which stats to use as the new reward item.
    + `op_type`: the operator to apply the new reward item to the original reward. For now, ["ADD", "SUB", "MUL", "DIV"] are supported.
    + `weight`: the weight of the new reward item.

In addition, there are several config items related to the data active iterator in `experience_pipeline` part, which is used to compute stats used to reshape rewards. This part is similar to the `task_pipeline` part in the previous example. The Data-Juicer config used here is:
```yaml
# This is a Data-Juicer data processing recipe
project_name: 'gsm-8k-experience-quality'

np: 32

process:
  - llm_quality_score_filter:
      api_or_hf_model: "qwen2.5-32b-instruct"  # use "qwen2.5-32b-instruct" to calculate the quality scores.
      min_score: 0.0
      input_keys: ["prompt_text", "prompt_text"]  # set input_keys and field_names to the existing key names in gsm-8k. Here calculating the difficulty scores according to both questions and answers.
      field_names: ["prompt", "response"]
```

All config items in the `data` section can be found [here](trinity_configs.md). A prepared config file for this example of GSM-8K can be found in [the config file of gsm8k](https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/grpo_gsm8k_experience_pipeline/gsm8k.yaml).

### Exploring & Training
After preparing the config files of Trinity-RFT, you can start your ray cluster and run the RFT process including the data active iterator part with the following commands:

```shell
# start the ray cluster
# on master node
ray start --head
# on worker nodes
ray start --address=<master_address>

# run RFT
trinity run --config <Trinity-RFT_config_path>
```

If you follow the steps above, Trinity-RFT will send a request to the data processor server and prepare the experience pipeline.
It will watch the explorer output buffer. Once there is a new batch of experience, the data processor will compute stats for the experience and reshape the rewards. Then it writes the reshaped experience to the trainer input buffer for training.


## Example: Human in the Loop
Sometimes, you might need to involve human feedbacks for some raw data. In this example, you will learn how to annotate raw data to get a better dataset before training. This example takes an example Q&A dataset and tries to select the chosen and rejected ones for DPO method.

Before getting started, you need to prepare the main environment of Trinity-RFT according to the installation section of the README file, and [start a label-studio server](https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/main/tools/humanops) from Data-Juicer from source.

### Data Preparation

#### Prepare the Data Processor

As the overall framework of Trinity-RFT shows, the data processor is one of the high-level functions. Trinity-RFT encapsulates the data processor as an independent service to avoid dependency conflict issues. Thus you need to prepare a split environment for this module and start the server.

```shell
# prepare split environments, including the one of data processor
python scripts/install.py

# start all split servers
python scripts/start_servers.py
```

### Configure the Data Processor

Trinity-RFT uses a unified config file to manage all config items. For the data processor, you need to focus on the `data_processor` section in the config file.

In this example, assume that you need to select the chosen and rejected responses for DPO method. So you can set these config items like the following example:

```yaml
data_processor:
  data_processor_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5005/data_processor'
  # task pipeline related
  task_pipeline:
    # I/O buffers
    input_buffers:
      - name: 'raw_input'
        path: 'tests/test_data/test_human_annotator'
        storage_type: 'file'
        raw: true
    output_buffer:
      name: 'raw_output'
      path: './outputs/task_pipeline_output/prioritized_gsm8k.jsonl'
      storage_type: 'file'
    format:  # set the field mappings
      prompt_key: 'prompt'
      chosen_key: 'chosen'
      rejected_key: 'rejected'
    #### new part about data active iterator
    dj_config_path: 'tests/test_configs/human_annotator_test_dj_cfg.yaml'
```

Here you can set the basic information for the example dataset, database information that is used to store the result dataset, and some other items about downstream dataset loading for exploring and training, which is similar to the example above.

For this example, we assume that you are somehow familiar with the basic usage of Data-Juicer, so we need to prepare a Data-Juicer data processing recipe in [`tests/test_configs/human_annotator_test_dj_cfg.yaml`](https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/blob/main/tests/test_configs/human_annotator_test_dj_cfg.yaml) that includes an OP of `human_preference_annotation_mapper`. For example:

```yaml
project_name: 'demo-human-annotator'
np: 1  # set np to 1 for human annotation OPs

export_path: './outputs/demo-human-annotator/annotated-data.jsonl'

process:
  - human_preference_annotation_mapper:
      # general annotation project settings
      project_name_prefix: "Human_Preference_Annotation_Demo"
      wait_for_annotations: true  # Whether to wait for annotations to complete
      timeout: 3600  # Maximum time to wait for annotations in seconds (1 hour)
      poll_interval: 10  # Time between annotation status checks in seconds
      max_tasks_per_batch: 10  # Maximum number of tasks in a single batch
      notification_config:
        enabled: false

      # label studio connection settings
      api_url: "http://localhost:7070"  # Default Label Studio URL
      api_key: "05409236-67a5-4169-af96-a52a818d0e81"  # Your API key for label studuio authentication # pragma: allowlist secret

      # human preference annotation settings
      prompt_key: "prompt"  # Prompt field
      answer1_key: "answer1"  # First answer option
      answer2_key: "answer2"  # Second answer option
      chosen_key: "chosen"  # Chosen field
      rejected_key: "rejected"  # Rejected field

```

You can set more config items for this OP (e.g. notification when annotation is finished). For more details, please refer to this [doc](https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/main/configs/annotation).

### Start Running

When you start running with the RFT config, the data processor will start the OP `human_preference_annotation_mapper`, and then you can find a new project on the "Projects" page of the label-studio server.

![](../../assets/data-projects.png)

You can click and enter into this project, and all the samples that need to be annotated are listed on the page.

![](../../assets/data-in-projects.png)

Then you can click any sample and you will enter the labelling page.

![](../../assets/data-in-labelling-page.png)

For the preference annotation case, you can choose the preferred/right/chosen one and then click the "Submit" button to submit the annotation result. Then you can select other samples and continue this process.

![](../../assets/data-labelling.png)

After all samples are annotated, the OP will end automatically and store the result dataset in the target database specified by the config file. When training begins, it will load the prepared dataset and continue the downstream steps.
