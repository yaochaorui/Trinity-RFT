# General Multi-Step RFT

In Trinity-RFT, we support general multi-step RFTs, which can be used to train agents by interacting with environments in multiple rounds.

Different from the [multi-turn RFT](./example_multi_turn.md) that concatenates the interaction results into one single `Experience`, this approach treats each step as an individual `Experience`, enabling RL agents to handle longer contexts.

We will now illustrate the general multi-step workflow using ALFWorld. For a hands-on look, you can skip directly to the [code implementation](#example-multi-step-alfworld).

## Build a general step-wise workflow

### Basic concept

In Trinity, we provide two types of general step-wise workflows: `StepWiseRewardWorkflow` and `RewardPropagationWorkflow`. These workflows setup the basic structure of a step-wise workflow and returns the a list of `experiences` in each run. Their difference is `StepWiseRewardWorkflow` computes the reward for each step and `RewardPropagationWorkflow` computes the reward after all steps and propagates the reward to the previous steps. See `trinity/common/workflows/step_wise_workflow.py` for more details.

To build a new workflow, you mainly need to identify each interaction step in `step()` and the reward function in `reward()`. For example, the core code of ALFWorld workflow is shown as follows:


```python
class StepWiseAlfworldWorkflow(RewardPropagationWorkflow):
    ...

    def step(self, step_num: int) -> bool:
        if self.done:
            return False

        # Format observation for the model
        format_obs = format_observation(self.observation)  # type: ignore
        self.memory.append({"role": "user", "content": format_obs})

        # Get action from the model
        responses = self.model.chat(self.memory)
        response_text = responses[0].response_text
        self.memory.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response_text})
        action = parse_action(response_text)

        # Execute action in the environment
        observation, reward, done, info = self.env.step(action)

        # Update internal state
        self.observation = observation
        self.done = done
        if self.done:
            self.final_reward = reward

        # Return False to stop the run if the episode is done
        return not self.done

    def reward(self, exps: list[Experience]) -> float:
        return self.final_reward
```

Also, remember to register your workflow:
```python
@WORKFLOWS.register_module("step_wise_alfworld_workflow")
class StepWiseAlfworldWorkflow(RewardPropagationWorkflow):
    """A step-wise workflow for alfworld task."""
    ...
```

and include it in the init file `trinity/common/workflows/__init__.py`

```diff
 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 """Workflow module"""
 from .workflow import WORKFLOWS, MathWorkflow, SimpleWorkflow
+from .envs.alfworld.alfworld_workflow import StepWiseAlfworldWorkflow

 __all__ = [
     "WORKFLOWS",
     "SimpleWorkflow",
     "MathWorkflow",
+    "StepWiseAlfworldWorkflow",
 ]
```

### Other Configuration

In general multi-step scenarios, each run may generate various number of experiences. To accomodate this case, we provide some flexible designs.

- `algorithm.add_strategy = step_wise_grpo`: This function allows you compute the advantages for the collected experience before adding to the buffer. For this example, we use `step_wise_grpo` which broadcasts advantages from the last step to previous steps.

- `buffer.train_batch_size`: The number of experiences to be sampled from the buffer for training, which can be different from the number of generated experiences in each explore step.

- `buffer.trainer_input.use_priority_queue = true`: Using `PriorityQueue` allows the model to use the experiences with higher priority.

- `synchronizer.sync_style = dynamic_by_explorer`: The explorer determines when to synchronize the model weights with the trainer.

Below, we provide the commands for running the ALFWorld task.

## Example: Multi-Step ALFWorld
### Environment Preparation
To install the ALFworld environment, you can follow the instructions below.

1. Pip install: `pip install alfworld[full]`

2. Export the path: `export ALFWORLD_DATA=/path/to/alfworld/data`

3. Download the environment: `alfworld-download`

Now you can find the environment in `$ALFWORLD_DATA` and continue with the following steps.

You may refer to the original [repository](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld) for more details.

### Data Preparation
Our dataset follows the format in Huggingface datasets library, so we should correspondingly convert our env dataset.

Just check the data preparation scripts and run the following command.
```bash
python examples/grpo_alfworld/get_alfworld_data.py
```

The task is described as an environment instead of a single prompt. The task description is the `game_file` file path.


### Config preparation and run the experiment

The default config file is [`alfworld.yaml`](https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/grpo_alfworld_general_multi_step/alfworld.yaml).
You may revise the configurations properly and run the experiment!

```bash
trinity run --config examples/grpo_alfworld_general_multi_step/alfworld.yaml
```

The results are shown in the following figure.

Note that we use a Qwen2.5-3B model fine-tuned with SFT as our starting point, ensuring that the model has some basic understanding of the environment.
