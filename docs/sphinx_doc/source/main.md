## üí° What is Trinity-RFT?

Trinity-RFT is a flexible, general-purpose framework for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of large language models (LLMs). It supports a wide range of applications and provides a unified platform for RL research in the [era of experience](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Era-of-Experience%20/The%20Era%20of%20Experience%20Paper.pdf).

The RFT process is modularized into three core components:

* **Explorer**: Handles agent-environment interaction
* **Trainer**: Manages model training
* **Buffer**: Manages data storage and processing

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Flexible RFT Modes:**
  - Supports synchronous/asynchronous, on-policy/off-policy, and online/offline training. Rollout and training can run separately and scale independently across devices.

* **Agent Framework Compatible Workflows:**
  - Supports both concatenated and general multi-turn agentic workflows. Automatically collects training data from model API clients (e.g., OpenAI) and is compatible with agent frameworks like AgentScope.

* **Powerful Data Pipelines:**
  - Enables pipeline processing of rollout and experience data, supporting active management (prioritization, cleaning, augmentation) throughout the RFT lifecycle.

* **User-Friendly Design:**
  - Modular, decoupled architecture for easy adoption and development. Rich graphical user interfaces enable low-code usage.

## üõ†Ô∏è What can I use Trinity-RFT for?

* **Train agent applications with RL and minimal migration cost**
  - Implement agent-environment interaction logic in a single workflow class ([example](/tutorial/example_multi_turn.md)),
  - Or import workflows from agent frameworks like AgentScope ([example](/tutorial/example_react.md)).

* **Rapid RL algorithm design and validation**
  - Develop custom RL algorithms (loss design, sampling strategy, etc.) in compact, plug-and-play classes ([example](/tutorial/example_mix_algo.md)).

* **Custom datasets and data pipelines for RFT**
  - Design task-specific datasets and build data pipelines for cleaning, augmentation, and human-in-the-loop scenarios ([example](/tutorial/example_data_functionalities.md)).
