# Email Search Workflow


This example shows a multi-turn email search workflow, inspired by [ART](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent?refresh=1756431423904). We implement a ReAct Agent and define tools for email search. Note that this example rewquires installing `AgentScope==0.1.6`.

## Core Components

We need to define some components:

-   `EmailSearchWorkflow`: The main class that orchestrates the entire process. It initializes the environment, manages the agent, and runs the task.
-   `EmailSearchAgent`: The "brain" of the operation.
    *   It receives the user's query and a system prompt.
    *   It decides which actions to take (e.g., which tool to use).
    *   It is built using the `AgentScope` framework.
-   **Tools**: These are the functions the agent can call to interact with the environment. Based on the code, these tools would likely include:
    *   `search_email`: To find relevant emails.
    *   `read_email`: To read the content of a specific email.
    *   `generate_response`: To provide the final answer when it is found. This tool can be inherited from the `AgentScope` framework.
-   **Judge LLM**: The judge LLM is used to evaluate the agent's performance, defined by `auxiliary_models`.


## Run the Experiments

### Step 1: Prepare the Database

We prepare the data by running the following command:

```bash
python trinity/common/workflows/envs/email_searcher/prepare_data.py
```

If you want to choose a new database path, you can modify the `DEFAULT_DB_PATH` in [`prepare_data.py`]. Also, remember to set an environment variable `DEFAULT_EMAIL_DB_PATH` to point to the database path before moving to the next step.


### Step 2: Run the Workflow

The config file is located in [`email_search.yaml`](https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/grpo_email_search/email_search.yaml).
To run this example, you can run the following command:

```bash
trinity run --config examples/grpo_email_search/email_search.yaml
```


## Evaluation Results

The results are shown in the following figure (the accuracy ranges from -0.1 to 1.0):
