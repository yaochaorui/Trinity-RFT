# Example: GRPO on MATH dataset

This example shows the usage of [RM-Gallery](https://github.com/modelscope/RM-Gallery/) by running GRPO on a MATH dataset. You need to install RM-Gallery first.
The dataset is organized as:

```jsonl

{"question": "what is 2+2?", "gt_answer": 4}
{"question": "what is 2+3?", "gt_answer": 5}
```


For more detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](../../docs/sphinx_doc/source/tutorial/example_reasoning_basic.md).

The config file is located in [`math.yaml`](math.yaml).
