# Example: REC on GSM8k dataset

This example shows the usage of REC on the [GSM8k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k).

For more detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](../../docs/sphinx_doc/source/tutorial/example_reasoning_basic.md).

The config files are located in [`gsm8k.yaml`](gsm8k.yaml) and [`train_gsm8k.yaml`](train_gsm8k.yaml).

# Group-relative REINFORCE Families
This folder provides **example configurations** for running different group-relative REINFORCE families within Trinity-RFT.

It includes three major families:

- **REC family** (clipping + importance sampling)
- **REP family** (regularization-based variants)
- **RED family** (data-distribution shaping strategies)

We also provide baseline implementations such as **Vanilla REINFORCE** and **GRPO**.

All algorithms are instantiated through modular YAML configs for easy reproduction and extension.

# Instantiations

## Baselines

### REINFORCE
Vanilla REINFORCE with group mean as baseline.

```
algorithm:
