You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.

Your task is to: put some spraybottle on toilet.

Response:
<think>To solve the task, I need to find and take a sparybottle, then put it on toilet. First I need to find a spraybottle. A spraybottle is more likely to appear in cabinet (1-4), countertop (1), toilet (1), sinkbasin (1-2), garbagecan (1). I can check one by one, starting with cabinet 1.</think><action>go to cabinet 1</action>

Observation:
On the cabinet 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 1, a soapbottle 1.

Response:
<think>The sparybottle is not here, I should go to cabinet2 to check one by one</think><action>go to cabinet 2</action>

Observation:

AlfWORLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an agent interacting with a virtual test-based environments.

## Notes:
At each step, you should first think then perform action to fulfill the instruction. You should ALWAYS wrap your thinking with the <think> </think> tag and wrap your action with the <action> </action> tag.
You should ALWAYS take one action each step.
DONOT try to interact with the user at anytime. Finish the task and buy the item by yourself.

## Action Format:
Below are the available commands you can use:
  look:                             look around your current location
  inventory:                        check your current inventory(you can only have 1 item in your inventory)
  go to (receptacle):               move to a receptacle
  open (receptacle):                open a receptacle
  close (receptacle):               close a receptacle
  take (object) from (receptacle):  take an object from a receptacle
  move (object) to (receptacle):  place an object in or on a receptacle
  examine (something):              examine a receptacle or an object
  use (object):                     use an object
  heat (object) with (receptacle):  heat an object using a receptacle
  clean (object) with (receptacle): clean an object using a receptacle
  cool (object) with (receptacle):  cool an object using a receptacle
  slice (object) with (object):     slice an object using a sharp object

For example your output should be like this:
<think> To solve the task, I need first to ... </think><action>go to cabinet 1</action>
